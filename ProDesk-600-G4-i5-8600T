## 🧠 Verdict

Excellent balance of performance and power.  
This system excels in multitasking, productivity, and general use with plenty of headroom thanks to its 6 cores.  
MX86 performance is GPU-bound — not ideal for physics-heavy real-time tasks, but very capable otherwise.

## 📝 Tester Notes

> “Fantastic mid-tier performer. Power use is efficient, and single/multi-core numbers are far beyond older-gen SFF chips. Weak iGPU shows up in WebGL tasks, but CPU more than makes up for it.”
