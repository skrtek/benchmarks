🧠 Verdict

👍 Excellent general-use Linux machine with strong performance for a 35W-class APU.  
🎮 Minecraft playable without shaders, decent in-game physics in MX86.  
🔥 Thermal behavior acceptable at full load with stock fan.  
❌ Shaders tank framerate significantly — GPU bottleneck expected.

📝 Tester Notes

> “Workload range wider than expected — YouTube stays efficient. MX86 handles 30–60 balls well. Minecraft is great stock, but shaders crush it. Feels snappier than specs suggest.”
