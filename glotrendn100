üß† Verdict

Solid and surprisngly fast and power effienct small PC. Can play older titles at 1080P Emulation is decent at 1080P. You could just leave this machine on at all times
and use it when needed as it barely uses power. N100 is very efficienct for a x86 part.

üìù Tester Notes

> Windows 11 UI is responsive. If someone were to replace this without me knowing for everyday tasks I would never notice. Single Channel ram is a bummer, although this unit does come with a fan 
  Changing resolution, usually to a higher one. Resulted in game crashes BL2, SS2, TL2	Gaming is a nightmare Older titles and emulation could not stand anymore of my life wasted in windows
  had to move on to Linux
  		
  Cachyos 
  KDE plasma is super smooth once the DE was set to personal likings. The first test resulted in a much higher FPS score. It must be the cachyos bore kernal as well as the MESA drivers which are
  becoming much more superior.
